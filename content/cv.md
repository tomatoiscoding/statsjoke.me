### Work Experience

- Data Scientist, [Percent](https://www.percent.cn/), 2017.5-2018.10

    I was a data scientist at Percent, a leading big data company in China. My responsibilities included developing statistical model for population projection and mastered knowledge in demography, analyzing malaria incidence dataset in Africa with spatial statistical methods. I also learned RNN, LSTM for natural language processing.

- Algorithm Engineer, [WeGene](https://www.wegene.com/), 2016.6-2017.4

    At WeGene, the largest DTC company in China, I developed algorithm and shiny apps for ancestry analysis and optimized the efficiency of the R code. Undertook task of analyzing Axiom genotyping array data. Investigated the accuracy of APoE genotypes derived from Axiom array.
