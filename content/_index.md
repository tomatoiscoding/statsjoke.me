## Beilei Bian

I will join [PCTG](http://cnsgenomics.com/index.html) at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) as a PhD student. My research focuses on Quantitative Genetics and Statistical Genomics. I'm interested in deciphering human complex traits with statistical methods. Some of my posts are in Chinese (most of them are about my life), and the posts in English mainly focus on my research.
